Project Overview 

Sophros aims to revolutionize personal health by empowering individuals to live a healthy lifestyle. First, Sophros provides visibility to individuals’ personal health levels by collecting disparate data on fitness level, nutrition, sleep, and weekly schedule. Second, Sophros will use this data to generate insights for the user to live healthier, particularly by generating a schedule. Third, Sophros will engage users by gamification of health progress and providing social networking to encourage friends’ success. 

Scope 

There are multiple facets to Sophros that make scoping the tool particularly interesting. Sophros collates holistic lifestyle data to try and generate insights, planning for people to make it easier to be healthy. The table below shows our scope decisions for the tool:

Table 1: Functionality Scope 

Macronutrient tracking will allow users to log foods and will compute daily totals of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats using the USDA nutrition database. These values are used by our optimization engine and health score. Exercise tracking means it will allow users to log minutes of light, moderate, and vigorous exercises via manual logging or automatic syncing. This data is used to estimate energy use and adjust calorie/macronutrient targets as well as for the health score. Sleep tracking records average sleep duration and times for use in the scheduling engine. Meal scheduling, workout scheduling, and sleep scheduling optimizes the times for each of these activities around someone’s age and work/school schedule, and nutrient scheduling schedules nutrient intake around these activities (ex. Optimizing for higher energy before a workout). iOS/Android mobile apps will be the primary method for users to interact with our application.  Meal suggestions will be the meal plans generated by our optimization engine, and the grocery list will be computed from this meal plan. Healthiness score is a holistic score of nutrient intake, sleep, and workouts for a user’s age, sex, and other factors. This is also the score that our application tries to maximize via scheduling and meal plans.  

Since our audience is primarily focused on maintaining and steadily improving lifestyle well-being, the focus of our scope is providing insights from convenient collection of data. Time management assistance is critically in-scope for the project, while carefully tracking every micronutrient is under evaluation for feasibility within our ease-of-use constraint. 

Assumptions & Constraints 

Audience: We assume our audience is people who care about their health and want to improve their well-being by eating better and tracking nutrients, but do not have the time to research and create plans independently. 

Based on this audience, we assume that the audience … 

Feels comfortable sharing their health data online 

Prefers mobile interfaces over web interfaces 

Focuses primarily on food and nutrition in health 

Values speed usage over granular accuracy 

 

On the technical front, we also make a series of assumptions that drive our architecture: 

Assume stable internet connection with capacity for high-bandwidth data transfer 

Assume professional data API from the USDA for food nutrition data 

Assume availability of public recipe databases 

Assume providing this advice does not constitute medical advising, or that no licensing is needed 

Assume that we have the right to cache recipes, nutrition data, etc. from our providers 

 

We also face a variety of constraints: 

Limited Budget constrains our server usage, AI integration options, and which databases we can use for recipes and health data 

Capacity and Processing Ability of Mobile Hardware limits our ability to compute recommendations locally and cache large amounts of data locally.

Development Methodology 

We chose scrum as our development methodology. Scrum fits Sophros because it is a complex, feature-rich mobile app with a cloud backend with many uncertainties around UX, optimization, and LLM behavior. We also have a fixed semester interval with maps naturally to sprints as well as pre-planned sprints in the form of a Gantt chart. We have prioritized “Must have” and “Should have” requirements which aligns with scrum’s incremental planning. Scrum will let us deliver working increments that we can demo and adapt to feedback and testing incrementally throughout the semester.
